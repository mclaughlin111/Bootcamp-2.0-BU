## We need an EmployeeBadge component

Looks like this:
![image info](./EmployeeBadge.png)

Is passed `Employee` type that is in `Employee.ts` as props (like all proper React components)

An example bit of data is in `employeeExample.ts`, the`tinky-winky.jpg` image is included (I'll let you work our how to include that in React :-)
