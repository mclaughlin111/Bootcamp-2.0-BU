## Get full name

1. Can you write a function called `getFullName` which takes 3 parameters:

- first name (compulsory)
- middle name (optional)
- last name (compulsory)

How do you do an optional parameter in TS? Where does this optional parameter have to be? (ref:[https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/typescript-optional-parameters/])

### Notes on the result

1. I am using the back ticks \`\` (template literals) to do stuff, how do these differ from single or double quotes (which are interchangeable in JS) (ref:[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals])

2. Why am I trimming the middlename at the start of the inline if statement? What does the question mark before the trim do there? Why is it necessary?

### Extensions

1. Create a version of getFullName that is passed a single object? What did you notice about this version? Did you prefer it? (There is an example of this in the solution)

# Add two numbers - testing
