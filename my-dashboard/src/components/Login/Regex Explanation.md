### Regular Expression: `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`

This regular expression is used to validate the format of an email address. Let's break down each component:

---

#### **`^`**
- **Meaning**: Anchors the regex at the start of the string.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the match starts from the very beginning of the string.

---

#### **`[^\s@]+`**
- **Meaning**: Matches one or more characters that are **not** a space (`\s`) or an `@` symbol.
- **Explanation**:
  - `^` inside the square brackets `[^]` negates the character set, meaning "anything except...".
  - `\s` represents any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line breaks).
  - `@` is literally the "@" character.
  - `+` means "one or more" of the preceding element, so `[^\s@]+` matches a sequence of one or more characters that are not whitespace or the `@` symbol.

---

#### **`@`**
- **Meaning**: Literally matches the "@" symbol.
- **Purpose**: This is the required separator between the local part (e.g., `user`) and the domain part (e.g., `example.com`) of the email address.

---

#### **`[^\s@]+`**
- **Meaning**: Matches one or more characters that are **not** a space (`\s`) or an `@` symbol.
- **Purpose**: Represents the domain part before the `.` (like `example` in `example.com`).

---

#### **`\.`**
- **Meaning**: Escapes the dot (`.`) character, matching a literal period (`.`).
- **Explanation**: In regular expressions, `.` is a special character that matches any single character, so escaping it with `\` makes it a literal period.

---

#### **`[^\s@]+`**
- **Meaning**: Matches one or more characters that are **not** a space (`\s`) or an `@` symbol.
- **Purpose**: Matches the top-level domain (TLD), like `com`, `org`, `net`, etc.

---

#### **`$`**
- **Meaning**: Anchors the regex at the end of the string.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the match ends at the very last character of the string.

---

### Summary:
This regex ensures that:
- The email starts with a sequence of characters that are not whitespace or `@`.
- This is followed by an `@` symbol.
- After the `@`, there is another sequence of characters that are not whitespace or `@`.
- Then there is a dot (`.`), followed by another sequence of characters that are not whitespace or `@`.
- The email must match this pattern exactly, with no extra characters before or after it.

**Note**: This is a basic email validation regex that covers common valid email formats but may not handle all edge cases or specific domain rules.
