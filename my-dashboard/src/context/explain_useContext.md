# Understanding `AuthContext` in React

## Overview

The `AuthContext` is a pattern in React that allows you to manage and share authentication state (such as user information) across your application. This is particularly useful for maintaining a logged-in user's information and making it accessible throughout your app.

## Key Concepts

### 1. `AuthContext`

The `AuthContext` is a React Context that holds the authentication state, specifically the user object, and a function to update that state. This context is created using `createContext` and is initialized as `undefined` to ensure type safety.

```typescript
import { createContext, Dispatch, SetStateAction } from "react";
import { User } from "./User";

type AuthContextType = {
  user: User | null;
  setUser: Dispatch<SetStateAction<User | null>>;
};

export const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType | undefined>(
  undefined
);
```
