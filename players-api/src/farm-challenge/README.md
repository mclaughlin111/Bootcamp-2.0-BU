# Farm Challenge

## Introduction

A farmer needs a UI to help sort and catalog her 1000 animals. You guys are going to build her one.

### Recommended Order of Construction

1. Build `FarmChallenge` page (in `farm-challenge` empty project) and put in scaffolding of page (h1, h2 headers, placeholders for component)
2. Build the 'dumbest' component first which is the `AnimalsTable`, also note some farm animals have appeared in the `public` folder! I'd like them to display with a height of 24px please.
3. Then build the following components:
   3.1 `NameFilter.tsx`
   3.2 `AnimalTypeSelect.tsx`
   3.3 `SortOrderSelect.tsx`
4. Then wire it all together in the FarmChallenge page!

## NOTE

1. All the API calls are super quick so we don't need `isLoading` indicators
2. We will obviously test (almost) all of this but lets do that later
3. Check out the `Farm_Database.pdf` for more details
